## 🧪 Test Your Production Setup

### Test Email Service (Contact Form)
1. Visit: https://www.sap-technologies.com/contact
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Submit
4. Check inbox: `muganzasaphan@gmail.com`
5. Expected: Email arrives within seconds ✉️

### Test API Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-render-app.onrender.com/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T...",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Generate Package Lock File (Recommended)
To make builds faster and more reliable:

```bash
cd server
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: Add package-lock.json for faster builds"
git push origin main
```

This will make `npm ci` work on Render (currently falling back to `npm install`).

### 2. Regenerate Gmail App Password (Optional Security)
Since the old password was exposed briefly:

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Delete existing "SAP Technologies" app password
3. Create new app password
4. Update local `.env`: `GMAIL_PASS=new_password`

Note: Not critical since production uses Resend, not Gmail SMTP.

### 3. Configure Cloudinary (Optional)
For production file uploads (profile pics, certificates, etc.):

1. Sign up: https://cloudinary.com (free tier: 25 GB storage)
2. Get credentials from dashboard
3. Add to Render environment variables:
   ```
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```
4. Redeploy on Render

### 4. Monitor Email Usage
Check Resend dashboard: https://resend.com/dashboard

- Current limit: 3,000 emails/month (free)
- Monitor usage to avoid hitting limits
- Upgrade if needed for higher volume

---

## 🚨 Warnings (Non-Critical)

These warnings appear in logs but don't affect core functionality:

- ⚠️ "We don't have access to your repo" → GitHub permissions notice, deployment still works
- ⚠️ "Cloudinary not configured" → Using local storage, fine for now
- ⚠️ "Backend-only deployment" → Expected, frontend served separately

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure latest commit is deployed
4. Test email service locally first
5. Check Resend dashboard for API errors
