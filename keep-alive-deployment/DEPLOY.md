## 📊 Monitoring Your Deployment

### Check Status:
- Visit: `https://your-app.onrender.com/`
- Check logs in hosting dashboard
- Verify pings in your main server logs

### Expected Logs:
```
🚀 SapTech Uganda Keep-Alive Service Started (24/7 RESILIENT MODE)
💪 MODE: NEVER STOPS - Infinite retry on failures
🌐 Target: https://sap-technologies-ug.onrender.com/api/health
⏰ Ping Interval: 5 minutes
✅ Server alive: OK (200)
```

---

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Service is running (check hosting dashboard)
- [ ] Web endpoint responds: `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
- [ ] Logs show successful pings every 5 minutes
- [ ] Your main server logs show incoming health checks
- [ ] No errors in deployment logs

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Service won't start:
- Check logs in hosting dashboard
- Verify `package.json` exists
- Ensure Node.js version is 18+

### Pings failing:
- Verify `SERVER_URL` is correct
- Check if `/api/health` endpoint exists on main server
- Check main server logs

### Service keeps sleeping (Render Free Tier):
This standalone service might also sleep on Render's free tier after 15 minutes of inactivity. To prevent this:
1. **Use UptimeRobot** to ping THIS service too!
   - URL: `https://sap-keep-alive.onrender.com/health`
   - Interval: 10 minutes
2. Or upgrade to Render paid plan ($7/month)

---

## 💡 Best Setup (Maximum Reliability)

```
UptimeRobot Monitor 1 → Main Server
        ↓
UptimeRobot Monitor 2 → Keep-Alive Service → Main Server
        ↓
Keep-Alive Service pings Main Server every 5 min
```

This creates **3 layers of protection**:
1. UptimeRobot pings main server directly
2. UptimeRobot keeps the keep-alive service awake
3. Keep-alive service pings main server

**Result: 99.99% uptime!** 🎉
