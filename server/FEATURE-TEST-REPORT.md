### 🔧 ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

#### Issue #1: Service Image Upload ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Service model missing `image` field (only had `images` array)
- **Impact:** Single image uploads were ignored by MongoDB
- **Solution:** Added `image: { type: String, trim: true }` field to Service model
- **Commit:** 7b1ab28

#### Issue #2: Project Image Upload ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Project model missing `image` field (only had `images` array)
- **Impact:** Single image uploads were ignored by MongoDB
- **Solution:** Added `image: { type: String, trim: true }` field to Project model
- **Commit:** 7b1ab28

#### Issue #3: Mongoose Duplicate Index Warnings ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Multiple duplicate indexes causing MongoDB warnings
  1. User.js: email unique, compound indexes
  2. Newsletter.js: email unique
  3. Contact.js: createdAt in compound index
  4. Award.js: slug unique, old duplicate block
  5. Project.js: duplicate createdAt index
- **Impact:** Server startup warnings, potential performance issues
- **Solution:** Removed all inline constraints and consolidated to schema.index()
- **Commits:** 2912250, 4b01a1a, bdf771b

#### Issue #4: Category Route Conflicts ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Routes defined in wrong order:
  - `/services/:id` matched before `/services/categories`
  - `/projects/:id` matched before `/projects/categories`
  - "categories" was being treated as an ObjectId parameter
- **Impact:** 500 errors on category endpoints
- **Solution:** Reordered routes - specific paths before parameterized paths
- **Commit:** b22c45b
